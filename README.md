# **WARNING**
**This code is terrible and riddled with exploits, use Sanctuary instead of this trash**

# The Oasis project
The goal of the Oasis project is to create a server that is free from hacks and crashes so that it is actually playable

**This project is based off of m.io by wwwg. You can find his repo here:**
https://github.com/wwwg/m.io

# Running the server
Because the oasis is in development, ther are no current scripts to ease installation and deplyment of an m.io server. Here are manual instructions (server starts on port 5000)
**PLEASE NOTE that running the Oasis Project requires node.js 6.0 or higher**
```
git clone https://github.com/Illya9999/OasisProject
cd OasisProject
npm install
npm run test
```

# Starting the client
The Oasis is a *server*, not a client. To use the default moomoo.io client, start the server and
in your browser, install oasis.user.js to tampermoneky or another userscript manager. Then visit oasis.moomoo.io

# FAQ
Q: I thought the oasis had an anticheat?

A: Yes we do. We decided to keep that closed source though.

Q: Is there a publicly hosted oasis server?

A: Yes there is. Please see official.user.js
# Directory roadmap
**THIS STUFF DOESNT REALLY REFLECT THE CURRENT STATE OF THE REPO**
`src/` - The server source code<br>
`tests/` - Test scripts<br>
`packetAnalyzer` - A userscript that is able to capture and log traffic between the Moomoo.io server and client
